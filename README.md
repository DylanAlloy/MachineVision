# MachineVision
OpenCV implementation using a webcam as input for a haar-cascade-based  vision recognition system. This is refined from the tutorial code on the OpenCV website. The changes I've made are in response to outdated practices in the official tutorial. This is a quick way to jump into object and abstract recognition with a computer, and learn to manage memory and processing requirements. 

You can also use the website to create your own haar cascades for detecting specific objects, etc.

Change line 4 in webcam.py, you'll know what to do!
